CSV files must have a single header line with column names

For non-charge changing transitions:

A =  mass number (int)
Z = proton number (int)
N = neutron number (int)

Element = short name of element, e.g. Mg (str)
Nucleus = A+Element, e.g. 24Mg (str)

Energy (keV) = Excitation energy of initial state (float)
Energy Unc (keV) = Experimental uncertainty on excitation energy of initial state (float)
E_gamma (keV) = Energy of gamma transition from experiment (float)
E_gamma Unc (keV) = Uncertainty on energy of gamma transition (float)

I_gamma = Intensity of gamma transition (float)
I_gamma Unc = Uncertainty on intensity (float)

B_exp Unc (W.u.) = Uncertainty on transition strength in Weisskopf units
B_exp (<X>) = Transition strength in X units
B_exp Unc (<X>) = Uncertainty on transition strength in X units

Ji = J of initial state (str, but sometimes entered as float or int, can be troublesome)
Jf = J of final state
ni = index of initial state (e.g. Ji,ni = 2,3 means the 3rd J=2 state) (int)
nf = index of final state
twoJi = 2 x Ji (int)
twoJf = 2 x Jf (int)

Thalf = experimental halflife, usually from NNDC in format like '26 FS 3', meaning 26*10^-15 +/- 3 seconds (str)
Thalf Value = coefficient of Thalf (float)
Thalf Units = units of Thalf (str)
Thalf Unc = Experimental uncertainty on halflife
Thalf (sec) = Thalf in seconds (float)
Thalf Unc (sec) = experimental uncertainty on Thalf in seconds (float)

Include = Whether to include in calculations or skip. Should probably be removed. (bool)
