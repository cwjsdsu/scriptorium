subroutine progressmessage(percent)
    ! Prints the current percent completion of a task.
    ! Use case: place this in a slow loop which otherwise doesn't print 
    ! progress information. This subroutine will continuously print the percent
    ! progress to standard output, but it will only use one line. This is 
    ! accomplished by printing backspace characters.
    ! The desired effect is only reached if no other print statements are used
    ! between calls to progressmessage.
